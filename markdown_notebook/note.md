### Project 1 - Markdown Notebook

- Before we start writing the code, let's talk about the app and review our objectives:
* The notebook app will allow the user to write notes in markdown
* The markdown will be previewed in real time
* The users will be able to add as many notes as they want
* The notes will be restored the next time the user visits the app

- To do that, we will divide the user interface into three sections:
* A main section in the middle with the note editor
* A right pane, which previews the markdown of the current node
* A left pane, with the list of notes and a button to add a new one
